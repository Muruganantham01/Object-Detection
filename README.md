# Object-Detection
## Overview:
The *Object Detection Project* utilizes the YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once) model to detect and classify objects within images. YOLOv7 is an advanced deep learning framework, known for its speed and accuracy, designed for real-time object detection tasks. The system analyzes an image, identifies various objects, and provides information about them by predicting their bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores. This allows for efficient and real-time processing, making it suitable for applications like autonomous vehicles, surveillance, and more.

## Features:
1. *Real-time Object Detection*: The project leverages YOLOv7's ability to perform object detection in real-time.
2. *Bounding Box Prediction*: Detects the position of objects within an image using bounding boxes.
3. *Class Labels*: Identifies different classes of objects (e.g., cars, people, animals).
4. *Confidence Scores*: Provides the model’s confidence in the predictions.
5. *Integration with OpenCV*: OpenCV is used for image processing, including resizing, normalization, and drawing bounding boxes on images.
6. *PyTorch Implementation*: The deep learning model is implemented and trained using PyTorch for flexibility and efficiency.
7. *Data Handling with Pandas*: Pandas is used to manage datasets, track performance metrics, and store detection results.

## Technologies Used:
1. *YOLOv7*: A state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm known for high accuracy and speed.
2. *OpenCV*: An open-source computer vision library for image manipulation, which aids in loading, processing, and displaying images.
3. *PyTorch*: A popular deep learning framework used for building, training, and evaluating the YOLOv7 model.
4. *Pandas*: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, particularly useful for handling large datasets and organizing results.
5. *Matplotlib* (optional for visualization): Often used for visualizing results, like plotting detection outputs.

## Available Scripts:
1. *train.py*: Script for training the YOLOv7 model on custom or predefined datasets.
2. *detect.py*: Script for detecting objects in new images or videos using the pre-trained model.
3. *utils.py*: Utility functions for data processing, loading images, and displaying results (bounding boxes, labels).
4. *test.py*: For testing the model's performance on a test dataset, evaluating metrics like mAP (mean Average Precision).
5. *preprocess.py*: For preprocessing the dataset (resizing, normalization) before feeding it to the model.

## Dependencies:
1. *Python* (version 3.x)
2. *PyTorch* (latest version compatible with your system)
3. *OpenCV* (opencv-python and opencv-python-headless)
4. *Pandas* (pandas)
5. *Matplotlib* (optional for plotting, matplotlib)
6. *NumPy* (numpy)
7. *Tensorboard* (optional for visualization)
8. *scikit-learn* (optional for performance evaluation)

Install dependencies via requirements.txt or by running:
bash
pip install torch opencv-python pandas matplotlib scikit-learn


## Steps for the Project:
1. *Set up the Environment*:
   - Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.7+).
   - Install the necessary libraries and dependencies (PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.) via pip.

2. *Prepare the Dataset*:
   - Use a pre-existing dataset (e.g., COCO, Pascal VOC) or create a custom dataset.
   - Annotate the data with bounding boxes and class labels (using annotation tools like LabelImg).
   - Organize the dataset into a structured folder (images and annotations).

3. *Preprocess the Data*:
   - Use scripts (like preprocess.py) to resize images, normalize them, and convert them to a suitable format for training (e.g., YOLO format).
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.

4. *Model Training*:
   - Load the YOLOv7 model and configure it for your task (e.g., modify the number of classes).
   - Start training the model using train.py. This will involve setting hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
   - Monitor the training process using loss curves and metrics like mAP.

5. *Model Testing and Evaluation*:
   - After training, test the model’s performance using test.py.
   - Evaluate the accuracy of the predictions on the test set and check the mAP score.

6. *Object Detection on New Data*:
   - Use the detect.py script to run inference on new images or videos.
   - The model will predict objects, display bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores.

7. *Visualization*:
   - Use OpenCV to visualize the predictions by drawing bounding boxes and labels on the images.
   - Optionally, visualize the results using Matplotlib for performance analysis.

8. *Model Optimization* (optional):
   - Consider fine-tuning the model or using techniques like *pruning* or *quantization* to improve inference speed, especially for real-time applications.
